C************************
C HANDLES SIMULTANEOUS PROJECTILE/TARGET EXCITATION
C   THIS IS A 32-GE DETECTOR 386+WEITEK SCALAR VERSION FROM MAR., 1989
C FULL Q MAPS CALCULATED FOR E1 THROUGH E4 - UPDATE FROM AUG. 1989
C NOTE: THERE IS NO LONGER THE DOMINANT MULTIPOLARITY SELECTED
C FULL MAPS AND FITTING OF E5,E6 ADDED - APRIL 1990
C XI AND ZETA RANGES CALCULATED FOR EACH MULTIPOLARITY INDEPENDENTLY
C
C May 1995 additions - matrix elements generator following general
C structure of matrix elements as given in Bohr-Mottelson book.
C Generator is activated by OP,THEO
C Using OP,THEO the starting values are set according to the model while
C all couplings are kept as given using ME suboption. OP,THEO writes
C matrix elements to restart file which should be used subsequently.
C
C Eh. Vogt's addition - OP,FILE - allows to specify OPEN statements,
C if convenient.
C
C November 1990 update - number of levels = 75, yields=32 x 1500
C magnetic substates = 600 matrix elements=500
C April 1991 update - OP,RAW added - handles non-efficiency-corrected
C spectra, allows to form Ge detector clusters. Up to 20 clusters
C can be defined. Number of physical Ge's increased to 200, while
C number of datasets (i.e. single detector+cluster gamma yields)
C is still limited to 32
C Output is written on unit 22 to avoid mixing it with system
C messages on some computers
C PIN diode option added -Sept. 96
C July 1997 - known matrix elements input in OP,YIEL extended to
C all multipolarities. Note change in the input, now:
C LAMDA, NS1, NS2, ME, DME

C            GOSIA HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BY T.CZOSNYKA,D.CLINE AND C.Y.WU
C            AT NUCLEAR STRUCTURE RESEARCH LABORATORY,UNIV. OF ROCHESTER
C
C            SOME CONCEPTS USED COME FROM 1978 WINTHER/DE BOER CODE
C            C O U L E X AND FROM NSRL DEEXCITATION CODE C E G R Y.
C            HOWEVER,THE PARTS TAKEN FROM BOTH CODES ARE IN MOST
C            CASES COMPLETELY REWRITTEN,SO THE SIMILARITY OF
C            VARIABLE AND ROUTINE NAMES MAY BE MISLEADING.
C
C            VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE ALSO MADE BY:
C            L.HASSELGREN AND A.BACKLIN  (UPPSALA)
