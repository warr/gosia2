switch.inc
----------
Gosia2 has the additional variable IBPS, which selects beam or target, which
is not used in gosia.

cinit2.inc
----------
This only exists for gosia2. It selects which normalisation coefficients to
use.

resc.inc
--------
This only exists for gosia2. It contains the matrix elements for the two
nuclei (target and projectile).

angula.f
--------
In gosia 2, we multiply Ygn by dsig*SIN(ttx). This is not done in gosia.

cegry.f
-------
If MCFIX is not set, we read the normalisation coefficients from CNOR1.

gosia2.f
--------
Lots of differences compared to gosia.f.

prelm.f
-------

There is some extra code for dealing with matrix elements from two nuclei
instead of one.
